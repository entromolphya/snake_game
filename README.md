# Snake Game

This is a simple Snake game built using Python's Turtle Graphics library. The game involves controlling a snake to eat food, grow longer, and avoid colliding with the walls or itself. The game keeps track of your score and ends when the snake hits the wall or itself.

## Features
- **Snake Movement:** Control the snake with the W, A, S, D keys.
- **Food Collection:** Eat the food to grow longer and increase the score.
- **Collision Detection:** The game ends if the snake hits the wall or its own body.
- **Scorekeeping:** Displays your current score and shows "Game Over" when the game ends.

## How to Play
1. Use the **W, A, S, D** keys to control the snake's movement.
2. The snake grows each time it eats food, and the score increases.
3. Avoid hitting the walls or the snakeâ€™s own body to stay in the game.
4. The game ends when the snake collides with a wall or itself.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
